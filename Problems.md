# Point-of-care-Code
# Problems of the source code:
# 1.The variables in the code is somehow confusing. There are some combinations of both new and old variable names, e.g. “cbd” in “CNN training & evaluation-intestinal parasites.py”refers to “readdata” class. We need the final version of the code with all the final variable names clear. 
# 2.“CNN training & evaluation-intestinal parasites.py”cannot be run, and there isn’t a result of it in its notebook.
# 3.The format and name of dataset does not match with the code, e.g. The dataset which we download from the website is in .jpg format and data annotations are in .xml format, while the code only refers to pictures in .png format. It is hard for us to use the dataset correctly.
